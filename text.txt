Hello world, my name is Sam and I am a student as well as a programmer.  
I study at VSIT where I keep learning and improving my coding skills.  
I enjoy contributing to GitHub by posting projects and useful code.  
This typing test project helps me practice and improve my speed.  
Programming is my passion and I am always excited to build new things.
